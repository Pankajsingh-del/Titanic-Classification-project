# Titanic-Classification-project
A Titanic survival classification project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived or not, based on a set of input features. This project is a classic example of binary classification in the field of data science and machine learning.

Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers into two categories: "Survived" or "Did not survive" based on a set of input features. This model can be used to analyze and understand the factors that contributed to survival rates on the Titanic.
